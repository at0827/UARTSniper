# UARTSniper: ELEC 327 Final Project

This repository contains the source code for an automated turret tracking system designed to point a light (LED) towards a detected face using a camera system. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi for face detection and two MSP430 microcontrollers to control servo motors for accurate positioning in both x and y axes.

# System Architecture

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 4: Runs the facial detection software and communicates coordinates to two MSP430 microcontrollers.
- Two MSP430 LaunchPads: Each controls one axis of a servo motor system. One MSP430 is dedicated to the x-coordinate, and the other to the y-coordinate.
- Two Servo Motors: Control the movement of the turret system along the specified coordinates.
- Camera Module: Connected to the Raspberry Pi to capture real-time video for face detection.
- LED: Attached to the turret and pointed in the direction determined by the servo's position.

## Software Components
- Python Script (turretMain.py): Implements the face detection using OpenCV and sends the coordinates of the detected face to the MSP430s via serial communication.
- MSP430 Firmware (main.c): Receives coordinates from the Raspberry Pi, calculates the PWM values using a mapping function to adjust the servo positions, and controls the servo motors accordingly.
  
## Power Considerations
- Using a 5V power pack such as a standard 5V phone charging power brick can cause the servos to shudder uncontrollably on startup.
- Potential fixes to this problem are to use a more robust power source, ie., using a brick that pulls power directly from a wall outlet and supports high current draw or to use multiple power bricks as well as wire a capacitor in parallel with each servo to offset current draw issues.
- Altenatively, using any standard laptop as a power source also works likely due to the laptops more sophisticated protocal for figuring out how much power needs to be supplied to the connected system.

# Installation

## Raspberry Pi Setup:
1. Install Python 3 and OpenCV.
2. Clone the repository and install required Python packages.
3. Connect the camera and configure it for facial recognition (turretMain.py)

## MSP430 Setup:
1. Flash the main.c code to the respective MSP430 devices.
2. Connect each MSP430 to a servo motor as per the wiring diagrams.

**Note:**
- Within turretMain.py, be sure to check which serial port corresponds to the axis controlled by the appropriate MSP (lines 227 and 234). If the MSPs are detected in the incorrect order, the axes will be flipped!
- You may need to calibrate the corners of the frames generated by the camera with the servo PWM values that point the LED (top left and bottom right) for best accuracy.

Assemble the turret structure with servo motors and mount the camera and LED as shown below.

# Usage

To run the system:

1. Power up the Raspberry Pi and MSP430s.
2. Execute the Python script to start the face detection and tracking:

```
python turretMain.py
```

3. Adjust the parameters in the script for serial detection, facial detection sensitivity, and motor responsiveness as needed.
